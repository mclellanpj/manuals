 _1. PAY ATTENTION WHEN FOLDING THE CARDBOARD. IF FOLDED WRONG WAY, YOU WILL NEED GLUE TO FIX IT._
 
 _2. GET READY TO GET DIRTY. LASERCUT CARDBOARD LEAVES BLACK SMUDGES ON YOUR HANDS._

(We recommend wipe every part with paper tissue.)

### Video-manual
Here is the original video-manual to build TJBot. You can follow it. The only major difference is in connecting the LED. TJBotCZ uses traditional RGB LED which is just resting on a platform below the top part (the head) - see the photos below. To fix the LED we rocommend using Blue Tack or similar sticky gum.

**Be careful:**
* fold cardboard the right way (on some parts there is instruction "fold up" or "fold down" (ohni dol≈Ø) - so better safe than sorry :)
* stick to the flow in the video manual so that ou do not have to re-assemble it later
  * especially when connecting the legs for stability
  * inserting the servo

### So what is different about TJBotCZ?

1. Part holding the speaker.
2. RGB LED

Good walkthrough of building TJBot is available also here:

For longer endurance we recommend stick some parts with glue-gun. Especially legs and parts holding the Raspberry Pi on the bottom.
